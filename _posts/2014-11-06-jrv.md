JRV (/ˈdʒɛrv / JVM Regex Validator) is a CLI interface for java regex validator.
The tool was made as an experiment for sbt-native-packager, yet as quite a few people asked, I decided to push it and release as a project.
Depending on flags JRV utility allows listing real directories or fuzzy-generation of a list based upon a base name.
By default a regex is applied to current directory to match file list to supplied regex.

The source is available at [github](https://github.com/peel/jrv).
Binaries for each release are available as deb, dmg and msi packages available at github [releases](https://github.com/peel/jrv/releases).

See [readme](https://github.com/peel/jrv/blob/master/README.md) available at Github to see more details.
