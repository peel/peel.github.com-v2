Monoids, functors, monads, categories and morphisms. Functional programmers often use their magick spells.
Do we need to care? Is it elitism or a real thing? Functional programming matters and it needs to be in everyones programming toolkit.
The talk introduces practical side of category theory and abstract algebra. From imperative to functional code in a small refactoring steps.
